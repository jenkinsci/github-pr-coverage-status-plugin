    When enabled plugin takes master coverage from Sonar instead of coverage
    tracked by build step "Record Master Coverage".
    <p></p>
    Enabling Sonar coverage doesn't remove recorded coverage or disable it's tracking. You can keep
    "Record Master Coverage" build step without changes.
    <p></p>
    By default plugin has own storage of master coverage to be able show icon with coverage difference.
    Plugin record master coverage based on build result in which you have added "Record Master Coverage".
    To authenticate to a Sonar instance one needs to specify login and password or an access token. Access token has priority.
    An additional option is to pass login and password as parameters on calling CompareCoverageStep from Jenkins pipelines.
