## Troubleshooting

### No coverage picture on GitHub Pull Request Page

If you see next picture on your pull request in GitHub:

![No coverage picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/github-pr-coverage-status-plugin/master/no-coverage-picture.png)

In most cases that mean that your Jenkins runs on ```http``` instead of ```https```
Plugin uses same protocol as your Jenkins, however GitHub in most cases accessible by ```https```
Default browser policy to block non secure resources on secure pages from unknown domain.

To fix that:

1. Configure Jenkins to be accessible for ```https``` https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins
1. Next you have a few options:
  * Run your Jenkins on ```https``` only
  * Or configure plugin to publish link on picture over ```https```
    * Open Jenkins
    * Click ```Manage Jenkins```
    * Click ```Configure System```
      * Find section ```Coverage status for GitHub Pull Requests```
      * Find property ```Jenkins URL for icon in Pull Request```
      * Put URL to your Jenkins with ```https``` like ```https://jenkins.my.com```
      * Save
    * Restart Jenkins
